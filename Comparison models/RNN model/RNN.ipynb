        "Next, we need import some libraries to use the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `import tensorflow as tf`: TensorFlow is an open source library for numerical computing and deep learning developed by Google. It is widely used to build and train machine learning models and neural networks.\n",
        "2. `from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential`: Sequential is a class of Keras, which is a high-level API for building neural network models. Sequential allows you to create models in the form of a linear stack of layers, which is useful for building simple and straightforward models.\n",
        "3. `from tensorflow.keras.layers import GRU, Dense, Dropout`: `GRU` (Gated Recurrent Unit) and `Dense` are capable types that can be implemented within neural networks to process sequences. `GRU` is similar to LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) whose main characteristics lie in performance and the solution of a classic RNN problem related to the memory of its gradients; On the other hand, `Dense` is a layer that allows each of its neurons to be completely connected to the neurons of the previous layer. Finally there is `Dropout` which is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. During training, some neurons are randomly deactivated at each step, forcing the network to learn more robust representations.\n",
        "4. `from tensorflow.keras.regularizers import L2`: `L2` is a form of regularization that penalizes large values of weights in a neural network. It helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the training error based on the magnitude of the weights.\n",
        "5. `from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam`: It corresponds to an adaptive optimizer that adjusts the weights of the neural network during training. It combines the advantages of other optimizers such as AdaGrad and RMSProp, and is very popular due to its effectiveness and efficiency.\n",
        "6. `from tensorflow.keras.metrics import Precision, Recall`:Libraries to implement the `Precision` and `Recall` metrics within the training cycle, allowing the learning growth of the models to be evident.\n",
        "7. `from tensorflow.keras import backend as K`: `backend` renamed `K` for use in code, is the Keras interface to the backend. It allows low-level operations to be performed directly on tensors and variables, which is useful for customizing specific aspects of model training, in our case the inclusion of metrics during the training cycle.\n",
        "8. `from tensorflow.keras.losses import Loss`: Base class for defining custom loss functions in Keras. Loss functions are used to evaluate how well the model is performing during training, that is, how well it is learning.\n",
        "9. `from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`: It corresponds to a scikit-learn function used to split a data set into two subsets: one for training and one for testing. This feature is essential for evaluating the performance of a model objectively, ensuring that it is trained on one data set and evaluated on a separate set.\n",
        "10. `from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder`: The `StandardScaler` library is a feature normalization tool based on a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1; To accompany it, `LabelEncoder` is used, which transforms categorical labels into numerical values.\n",
        "11. `from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, f1_score, confusion_matrix`: By importing `accuracy_score` you access the function that calculates the accuracy (Proportion of correct predictions over the total predictions made); when `precision_score` is imported, the function that calculates the precision (Proportion of TP over total predicted positives[TP+FP]) is accessed; when you import `f1_score`, you access the function that calculates the F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Finally by importing `confusion_matrix` you can generate a confusion matrix showing the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives.\n",

        "Next, we need import some libraries to create graphics.\n",
        "1. `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`: Python plotting library, `pyplot` is a module of `matplotlib` that provides a MATLAB-like interface for creating plots. It allows you to create a wide variety of graphs such as line, bar, scatter, histograms, among others. Generally renamed to `plt` for ease of use in code.\n",
        "2. `import seaborn as sns`: It allows the visualization of statistical data in a more attractive way; the library is characterized by allowing an easy creation of the same. It is usually renamed with `sns` to improve its usability in the code.\n",

        "6. `import numpy as np`:Fundamental component for numerical computation in Python, as it provides support for multidimensional arrays and matrices, as well as a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays."
